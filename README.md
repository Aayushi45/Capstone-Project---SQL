# Capstone-Project---SQL

📌 Overview<br/>

This project focuses on analyzing an airline database using SQL to extract valuable insights about flights, passengers, bookings, and airport operations. The queries help answer key business questions related to flight schedules, delays, cancellations, passenger spending, seat allocations, and airport statistics.


📊 Project Objectives<br/>

--Perform data extraction and transformation using SQL queries.<br/>
--Identify highest and lowest-paying passengers on a monthly basis.<br/>
--Analyze flight operations to find the longest flights, morning flights, and busiest routes.<br/>
--Evaluate airport performance, including the most and least busy airports.<br/>
--Investigate seat allocation trends and count business-class aircrafts.<br/>
--Assess cancellations and delays for Airbus and Boeing flights.<br/>
--Generate refundable passenger lists due to flight cancellations.<br/>

📂 Datasets Used<br/>

The analysis is based on multiple tables from the airline database:

--Bookings: Flight booking records with transaction details.<br/>
--Flights: Flight schedules, departure/arrival details, and aircraft codes.<br/>
--Passengers: Passenger details including ticket numbers and bookings.<br/>
--Boarding Passes: Tracking passenger boarding status and seat allocations.<br/>
--Airports: Airport names, locations, and time zones.<br/>
--Aircrafts: Details of aircraft models, their range, and operational performance.<br/>

📌 Key SQL Queries Implemented<br/>

✅ Data Formatting: Convert book_date into "YYYY-MMM-DD" format.<br/>
✅ Passenger Insights: Identify top and least-paying passengers per month.<br/>
✅ Flight Analysis: Find the longest flights and earliest morning flights by airport.<br/>
✅ Airport Operations: Determine busiest and least busy airports based on flight departures.<br/>
✅ Seat Allocation: Identify least assigned seats and count business-class aircrafts.<br/>
✅ Cancellation Analysis: List Airbus/Boeing flights that were canceled or delayed.<br/>
✅ Refund Processing: Generate a list of passengers eligible for refunds due to cancellations.<br/>

🛠️ Technologies Used<br/>
